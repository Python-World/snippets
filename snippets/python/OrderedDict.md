# OrderedDict in Python
An OrderedDict is a dictionary subclass that remembers the order that keys were first inserted. 
The only difference between dict() and OrderedDict() is that:

OrderedDict preserves the order in which the keys are inserted. A regular dict doesnâ€™t track the 
insertion order, and iterating it gives the values in an arbitrary order. By contrast, the order the
items are inserted is remembered by OrderedDict.

# A Python program to demonstrate working of OrderedDict 

from collections import OrderedDict 
  
print("This is a Dict:\n") 
d = {} 
d['a'] = 1
d['b'] = 2
d['c'] = 3
d['d'] = 4
  
for key, value in d.items(): 
    print(key, value) 
  
print("\nThis is an Ordered Dict:\n") 
od = OrderedDict() 
od['a'] = 1
od['b'] = 2
od['c'] = 3
od['d'] = 4
  
for key, value in od.items(): 
    print(key, value)
